# third life rehashed
 rehashed life series for my own personal use, however made public as felt others may like to see how i did it / use themselves. this uses my username in minecraft (hxrry27) as all op and perm based things, so that would need to be altered to your own

i also run luckperms with this to prevent users in the game being able to see / use all functions as it would cause chaos, and similarly, the reset trigger should only be used upon game finishing. this will ONLY reset all online players, so note that before using. 

full credit of course goes to grian, and his team, for putting this together in the first place, this is just so i can recreate the enjoyment with my mates :)
